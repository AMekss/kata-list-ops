# Aprils Edition - ListOps

coding challenge repo for hh.ex april edition

## Description:

This time we are going to go write some functional programming basics ourself. We are going to implement List operations like `count`, and `reverse`.

We have some tests prepared, you can run them as usual with `mix test`.

:warning: Don't cheat! Avoid `Enum`, `List`, or similar things from the StdLib. :warning:
